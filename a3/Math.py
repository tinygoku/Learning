# not sure if you want it like this, or if you want it that if you repeated the digits 
# it would tell you to not do it and ask you again to insert numbers
# that seemed more complicated, im guess you need some sort of loop(no idea what loops are, but people always mention them 
# when i try to google for stuff haha
